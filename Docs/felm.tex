\section{Temat}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Celem projektu jest zadanie semantyki oraz implementacja interpretera dla reaktywnego języka funkcyjnego będącego minimalnym podzbiorem języka Elm, opisanym jako FElm w pracy: \href{http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/abstracts/CzaplickiC13.html} {Asynchronous Functional Reactive Programming for GUIs}, na której oparty jest projekt.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Podstawowe założenia}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
  \item gorliwy
  \item silnie, ale dynamicznie typowany
  \item podstawowe konstrukcje dla sygnałów, tj. lift oraz foldp, ale bez async
  \item podobnie jak w Elmie - brak sygnału sygnałów oraz sygnałów definiowanych rekurencyjnie
  \item typy danych: liczby całkowite, wartości boolowskie i oczywiście sygnały
  \item wejście - zdefiniowany z góry zbiór sygnałów wejściowych
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Składnia}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Składnia języka jest całkowicie zgodna z \cite[p.~3.1]{CC}, w związku z czym nie podajemy jej definicji ponownie w tym dokumencie.
